List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning - This is deciding what the software should do and why it is     
  needed.Includes talking to stakeholders who will benefit from the software to 
  understand their needs and setting foals for the project.
2.Requirements - defining what the software must do in order to meet the needs 
  identified in the planning stage.Includes creating a list of features and functions 
  the software should have.
3.Design - this involves creating a blueprint how the software will work. It involves 
  designing of the software architecture ,user interface and data storage.
4.Implementation(coding) - writing the actual code to create the sofware.
5.Testing - this is checking whether the software works correctly and meets the 
  requirements.Includes running the software in diffferent scenarios to find and fix 
  bugs.
6.Deployment - this is making the software available to users,installing it on users 
  end devices or making it available online.
7.Maintenance - keeping the software up to date and fixing any issues that arise.
8.Documentation - creating guides and manuals to help users understand the use of the 
  software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodolofy us a linear approach to software development where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next with no overlaps between the stages whereas The Agile methodolgy is an iterative and incremental approach to software development ,which emphasizes flexibility ,collaboration and customer feedback.
The comparison for the two methods is as below;
 1.Waterfall has a linear approach while Agile an iterative approach.
 2.Waterfall has low flexibility while Agile has a high flexibility
 3.Waterfall has low customer involvement while Agile has high customer involvement.
 4.waterfall is difficult to incorporate changes while Agile easily adapts to changes.
 5.waterfall is suitable for well defined unchnaging projects while Agile is suitable 
   for dynamic ,evolving projects.

scenarios where appropriate;
Waterfall is suitable for developing softwares for a regulated industry i.e helathcare where requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change.
Agile is more suitable for developing a mobile or web application where user feedback is critical for success.Agiles nature allows for continous user feedback and adjustments to improve the product.
